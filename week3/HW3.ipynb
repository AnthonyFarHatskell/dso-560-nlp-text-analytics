      "Review 2: toxic dump! in food quality and employee humanity/work efforttypically, i do not eat mcdonalds food; yet similar to the experience of others \"trapped\" at northside hospital there is no other option if you are hungry outside of the hospital cafeteria hours of operation. due to a relatives stay and my visits/overnights for 11 weeks~ i too found myself \"trapped\" and therefore forced to buy at mcdonalds. mostly my visits were for coffee or icecream sundaes. however, last night, for the first time i ordered food (grilled chicken salad) i returned it ~ the meat smelled badly. this did not surprise me and only enforced my resolve to avoid chain food restaurants.what did surprise me and absolutely shocked me was the customer service offered by employees ~ how in the world can you be an employee here and not for one minute or even a second acknowledge the obvious fact that you work inside a hospital; then consider what that means for each and every person that approaches your counter to order. how you do not see them, in fact that you easily dismiss them, is beyond my comprehension to understand! how you lost your sense of humanity, in all honestly should cause you to pause and contemplate this ~ are you not aware that you are reflecting how you measure within you your own sense of dignity?within my and family/friends of patient at northside hospital for the past 11 weeks: each and every time i/they had to place an order i /they was/were subjected to mcdonalds toxic business model (in food) which now has transferred (we learned) into their employees. not once was i thanked for giving my order; not once was i thanked when delivered my order. yet, at every visit i waited and witnessed employee behaviors that were readily displayed and relayed in body language, effort toward actual work, and obvious attitude not only toward me, but guests in front of me. god forbid i happened to have question in reference to the menu (employee response: blank stare, shrug, looking behind them at menu only to turn back around with a blank stare and/or shrug again). god forbid, on separate occasions i happened to ask for a spoon/napkin/straw. last night, i happened to ask for my drink please (after receiving my salad and waiting for longer than normal) yikes, you think i had asked him to draw blood!***one more detail regardless if i arrive at 2am, 4am or between 7:30 pm ~ 11 pm this mcdonalds is always consistently filthy! not just dirty, but filthy!can anyone lift a broom to sweep up the garbage in the service/cooking area; also in the dining room?can anyone clean the crud surrounding the plastic display case for cookies already? it's been 11 weeks and that crud is still smeared dried; just gross.wash/disinfect the countertops, payment pads, straw holders, everywhere spills occur; including areas customers touch. every hour! get it? every single hour! get a cleaning only employee! this employee will do nothing but be the ocd employee you need! just stop this atrociously dirty & disgusting feeding trough you call a restaurant. you should be ashamed.**************************************************î_**************************************northside hospital ~ you are responsible for allowing this restaurant to wallow within your walls! how many more years will you ignore not only the unhealthy food options mcdonalds supplies~ but to continue to allow a daily dose of deliberate and diligent unhealthy, negative, and \"put upon\" attitudes from employees, to be delivered to family, friends and employees that are there only because they care and are there for your patients! how this does not cause you to react and act is beyond me.in my world, with so many options available, this place would be gone ~ like today; certainly not any longer than tomorrow!this toxic waste site is dumping daily doses of negativity, inhumanity~ its seeping and reverberating within the walls of this hospital. i know you feel it!\n",

      "Review 1: quick, somebody call the fire department. there's a carbon monoxide leak at the mcdonald's on 6th and 1st ave. the staff are showing the telltale sluggish, sleepy signs of poisoning.this place makes me sad. every time i go, i see a herd of people standing at the counter. it begins the inevitable questioning:\"did... i'm sorry, have you ordered?\"\"no, not yet.\"\"oh, ok, um, ma'am have you ordered?\"\"oh no, i'm just here to read the pretty signs.\"etc., and so on, etc....when you do order, the real chaos in the kitchen begins. i've seen gordon ramsay on calmer days then some of these people.\"angel, for god's sake, i need four burger five minutes ago, what is taking you so long?!?!\"mark, i'm doing the best i can and i'm having a really bad day, so step off, ok!?! ok?!?!\"this played out between numerous employees while waiting for my food. i didn't even try to hide the laughter.these days, the only mcdonald's i tend to visit fall under three categories:1) i am within 1/2 of a freeway and there are no other options2) i am in high school, its 2 am, it's suburbia, i'm hungry, and there are no other signs of life3) i'm jonesing for hi-c orange drink (the colloquial, vivid description of the beverage is what really draws me in)i took the commercials' advice and took advantage of my right as a new yorker to order the big burger. i had one earlier in the month and i remembered it being much better than your general ten-packets-of-sugar-per-bun-grade-c-beef micky d's fare.oh wow. this was bad. and i mean bad. it's awfulness may or may not have been highlighted by the fact that i was reading an article as i ate about the fatal cases of \"superbug\" staph infections being on the rise in new york. the mayo had the appearance of cream cheese. the onions looked, felt, and tasted as though they had spent the better part of a week floating in water. burger meat itself was bland, flavorless, and had the consistency of - oh, what the hell am i doing. am i really here, wasting a beautiful sunday afternoon sitting in my living room to write about the inferior quality of a meal at mcdonald's? am i that sad?this mcd's in particular is used as a haunt for the local, random old people clique that you will find in every neighborhood on earth. an old woman took a table of four to herself next to me (even though seating was scarce as it was) and began conversations with, like, 4 people who walked in.oh, and do you know what i noticed today? the aftertaste of dr. pepper tastes exactly like play-doh! it's so weird! half the people who read that just went \"wtf, you ate play-doh as a child???\" and the other half went \"oh my god, i know exactly what he's talking about!\" i mean, come on, it says non-toxic right on the can, and the pizzas i used to make with blue and purple toppings were simply too tempting...i dare someone to click \"formal (jacket required)\" for dress for this place.ok, i'm done with this review.\n",

      "Review 2: today was the breaking point. long ago, mcdonald's revolutionized the restaurant industry with fast food dining, a paragon of what was possible when human ingenuity applied itself to streamline processes and deliver maximum production and food for people in the least amount of time. these days, efficiency no longer matters and has been replaced with indifference, complacency, and a lack of disregard to customer priorities. on most mornings, i will stop into mcdonald's to grab a yogurt parfait for $1.12 as my morning breakfast. i did it because it was a healthy breakfast, tasted good, and was amazingly cheap. before today, one of the top ten things i associate with mcdonald's is efficiency, and today i can throw that word out the window because mcdonald's no longer merits it.today i left my house early for the express purpose of ordering more food for breakfast because i didn't have dinner and i was short on sleep and needed a giant coffee to go with some food to keep me sane for a long day at work. i arrived at 8:44am and i know this because foursquare told me so when i checked in! something was amiss and there was a large crowd of people and lines that were simply not moving.great, these things sometimes happen, which was why i was glad that i left my house early so that if i actually did have to wait in line it wouldn't matter and i'd still be able to get what i wanted when i wanted it. the minutes started flying by and the line still wasn't moving! what happened to that proud tradition of corporate efficiency to deliver the customer what they wanted when they wanted with the highest degree of professionalism and courtesy? well you can all forget about it because it's clear that no one in this mcdonald's during the morning shift gives one iota of care for anyone waiting in line.i got to be the third person in line when two customers started to argue with the cashier that they wanted cream on the side of their coffee and not mixed in. the clerk wouldn't make a new coffee for the customers and the customers weren't having any of it. watching these people argue with the clerk got my blood boiling because i was trying to get an order in and get to work on time! because of the inability of the clerk to placate these customers i ended up stuck in line waiting, waiting, and waiting in what seemed to be forever!having arrived at 8:44am, it was now 8:54am and i hadn't made an order! i yelled in frustration about the utter lack of disregard the staff had much to the amusement of the other patrons who were all either waiting for their order or waiting to order who all were in the same boat. i slammed the door on leaving and walked a block over to starbucks. at starbucks i spent $5 for a giant cup of coffee and no food - $5 i could have easily spent at mcdonald's in order to get what i wanted, but apparently mcdonald's no longer cares about earning my money since they are too busy arguing with other customers and making everyone wait to order and wait for their food. long gone are the good old days of the quick food restaurant, this mcdonald's no longer adheres to any sense of time or service and has degenerated into the ultimate display of incompetency. there are not enough words in all of the languages i speak to describe the disgust that i experienced today at this mcdonald's. it was disgraceful and a thorough exercise in human futility and it was ten minutes of my life that i will never gain back.\n",

      "Review 1: years of pathetic service, disgusting food, and dangerous mistakes. why do i keep going back?having nothing to do with mcdonalds food in general and more to do with the ability of this specific location to produce it with out killing anybody. i have been going to this particular store for years. it is right around the corner from where i used to live, and is on the way from where i live to pretty much everything i use (gas station, costco, movie theater, market, etc). it is the only convenient location, and for a while mcdonalds was the only place that had $1 drinks. so those are my lame excuses for repeatedly torturing myself with this horrible place! service: i used to be a manager with another fast food chain. i know what service should be. i also know what it usually is. it doesn't have to be 5 star. but the rude attitudes, ridiculously slow service, and inability to get a single order right is really a bit too much. when i say slow service, i am talking 15 minutes is average drivethru time for a dollar burger and a soda. correct orders: yes, my order can occasionally be complicated (no castup, add big mac sauce)... but when i thought they could do no worse... they messed up an order for 4 large drinks. 2 diet cokes, a lemonade, and an unsweet iced tea (all with extra ice). we received a regular coke, a lemonade, a dr. pepper, and a sweet iced tea. 2 drinks had no ice at all. and the other 2 had a few pieces floating around. we have never received a correct order from this store. ever. i could go on and on about it, but i will stick with this sad example and move on.dangerous/disgusting/incorrectly made: something a little different then an order where they put the wrong thing in the bag or mess up a custom, is when they just make it incorrectly or dangerously. some of the examples of this include pies that expired an hour before i received them, an egg that was completely raw in the middle, and tonights lovely mess up. tonight i ordered the angus mushroom and swiss. according to the website this should include 2 full slices of swiss cheese and a decent amount of mushrooms. i had about a teaspoon of mushrooms, no sauce, and 1/2 a slice of cheese. that is right, they left off a slice and a half of cheese! in addition, it was a regular (and relatively old) quarter pound patty, not the big ole angus patty they should have used. i have called the number on the receipt multiple times that takes me to the district office. they consistently send out a free sandwich or drink coupon to apologize. they tell me how sorry they are and suggest i try one of their other locations, as this is the only one they receive complaints from. from what i was told they are revamping this store, but i have been told that for well over a year, and it seems to have been unvamped and going down hill, which i didn't think was even possible! i keep vowing this will be my last visit, but then find myself sitting in the drivethru line yet again wondering if i will ever receive my food. i highly do not recommend this location. hopefully you won't be lured in by whatever the heck keeps luring me! -sarah (this was written by paul's wife because i am usually the one dealing with them. i guess he got smarter.)\n",

      "Review 1: it's 2 for 1 review day! i can't review the walmart without reviewing the mcdonald's that resides inside. and boy is it some tantalizing stuff.i try not to give too many 1-star reviews but this mcdonald's so deserves it. i hardly frequent a mcdonald's at all (although this is my second mcdonald's review in less than a week) but i need to let the peeps in on this one. no yelper should go unwarned. of course i came to mcdonald's since i have those coupons for their new contraption, the mcwrap. which when i pronounce very fast and in my scottish accent sounds much like 'mccrap'. after my second go round with this thing, i have made up my mind it is decidedly so. i need to write mcdonald's execs to change the name on this thing immediately.my coupon for the day was buy a medium fries and a medium drink, get a mcwrap of your choice for free. i have a hard time resisting free. i'm here to tell you...worst almost free meal of my life!!! seriously.it was the tail end of lunchtime so the line was still a bit busy. i patiently waited for almost 10 minutes...which is like forever in mcdonald's time. at least two folks left the line while i was there. i know it's not mcdonald's fault, but the couple in front of me took up majority of the line space because they were in motorized wheelchairs. and they were very loud. this doesn't bother me much. but...they were also very stinky. yes, stinky. i have no problem with stinky in most cases (i occasionally help the homeless so i know) but the guy in front of me hadn't washed in days if i were to guess. to each his own, and i know it's almost summer so i know we all want to save water...but damn. if i get a whiff and i have to take a step back? you might be s-t-i-n-k-y. but who am i to judge? i took a big step back and waited my turn. free is the motivation here. i finally get up there to the mcdonald's cashier and present my coupon to the guy. he takes a look at it and says 'we don't usually take the promo coupons at this location but we'll let you use it.\" then he proceeds to put the coupon onto a stack of...more coupons! mind boggling to say the least. he takes my order of a medium fries and medium drink, asks me what type of mcwrap i want (grilled chicken & bacon) and rings me up. $2.91 later i'm given my receipt and asked to wait for my number to be called.i wait. and wait. #1! #2! #3! #5! #6! #7! #8! obviously i'm #4 and 10 minutes later i am still waiting. honestly, what the hell are you guys doing back there? mixing the masa for my fresh pressed tortilla? feathering a chicken? perhaps ripening a tomato? i ask the mcdonald's runner and he tells me, \"we're waiting for your mcwrap.\" of course.at this point i'm almost running late to be back at work, so the minute i get my order i bolt back to the office and have lunch at my desk. thankfully i'm only three minutes away. i really, really should have just gone to the vending machine or eaten my stash of reese's chocolate peanut butter eggs from last easter. talk about disappointment! i take out my mcwrap from my bag and lay down the box of fries on my desk. i continue working while munching away on what is supposed to be mcdonald's claim to fame. their golden fries. i bite into one, eh a bit stale. i bit into another one, eh not enough salt. i bite into yet another one, eh cold?? i look down, and whaddaya know? my damn fry is not even barely cooked! white like olivia wilde in the winter. i look through the entire box and find at least half a dozen fries not cooked properly! not golden brown! not delicious! barely out of their frozen state, and just limp. not acceptable! please check my pic for proof of this travesty. mcdonald's not doing their fries right is like ikea not serving their swedish meatballs with gravy. no bueno.after getting over this somewhat i finally hit my stride to go on to my grilled chicken & bacon mcwrap. wow, talk about lightning striking twice. this thing was lifeless! after unwrapping this beast (the box is still the best part about this mcwrap), i could just tell something was off. tortilla was already showing signs of being soggy way too long. the chicken peeking out of the top was not looking tip top shape either. after some hesitation, i took a bite. ugh i say, ugh! freshness was not part of the gameplan for this mcdonald's today. all cold and soggy! and upon all, my mcwrap wasn't built correctly! instead of having spring mix like it's supposed to, there was plain old shredded iceberg lettuce! and my bacon was missing! in the words of our lord darth vader....noooooooo! it was mccrap through & through. totally upset over this one. i have picture proof of this travesty of gourmet eats as well. mcdonald's you have pissed off the wrong fatty. i will definitely be calling your hotline to complain about this one for sure. knowing my luck i'll get a coupon for a free mcwrap. crap.\n",
      "Review 2: located on the border of the west and greenwich village, this mcdonald's restaurant (which according to wikipedia is a part of the world's largest chain of burger fast food restaurants) is in a prime location.while the decor is a little dated, it reflects the some of the architecture and older buildings in the village. there is also a great hanging mural of basketball players located above the register and can be better viewed while dining on the second floor of the establishment (the art most likely drew inspiration from the west 4th street courts located across from the restaurant, paying homage to the locals).instead of order from a waiter you order individually through the designated cash registers, while this may seem like more work it does save you some extra cash and also lets you customize your order directly without having to go through another person. the menu itself has it's staples, 'the big mac' , 'filet-o-fish', 'mcnuggets' and of course the french fries which are all bargains for the amount of food you receive when compared to other restaurants. there is also an ever changing rotation of new sandwich, wraps, salads and other specialty items; all of which have the same mcdonald's quality.this past visit i ordered a mcdouble, a large french fires and a 4 piece mcnuggets. the food was ready for me in under five minutes, a time almost unheard of at other restaurants. i took a seat at the upstairs section and started with the mcdouble. the mcdouble included two cooked beef patties, cheese, pickles, ketchup and chopped onions, very satisfying for under 2 dollars. i then switched between the hot crispy french fries and the mcnuggets (small deep fried pieces of chicken) which i dipped in ketchup and their very tasty honey mustard sauce. all in all i was very full and content with my meal, all of which cost me under $10, at any other local restaurant just burger and fries would have run me more than $10 and most likely closer to $15.although the food may not be on par, quality wise with other nearby eateries (minetta tavern, 100 acres and market table), essentially you are getting a full meal at nearly half the price and a quarter of the time. i would highly recommend this mcdonald's and look forward to visiting their other locations.\n",

      "Review 1: this review screams \"first world problems\"...but until yelp opens up a site that allows us to review establishments in the \"third world\" (can one even still use that term without being offensive?), i guess all of the things about which we gripe will be \"first world problems,\" won't they?anyhow, my wife was hungry one evening so we stopped here to grab a bite to eat through the drivethru. we actually enjoy eating at mcdonald's in general and think the food is good (some people will probably find that statement more offensive than the above comments about terminology!), so it's not like this was a bad option. we actually used to stop at this one pretty often on our way home from church when we lived on the east side and we generally received great service.unfortunately, tonight was a night on which we received awful service.when we pulled up to the drivethru, the mcdonald's employee let loose with this rapid-fire barrage that was presumably supposed to tell us what food wasn't available. i'm a teacher, and i'm used to deciphering...but this was incomprehensible. of course, when we mistakingly ordered something that was deemed off-limits, we were made to feel like buffoons.after we finally managed to figured out what was available, we ordered and pulled up to the window. you don't need a crystal ball to figure out what happened next--that's right, they got the order partially wrong. one of my wife's chicken mcnuggets even wound up outside of the container. perhaps it was in a hurry to escape an environment completely void of any sort of concern for the customer, or perhaps they couldn't be bothered to take an extra second to close the container fully. i'll let you be the judge on that one. they also gave her the wrong sauce. i had no idea that \"sweet and sour\" actually means \"barbeque.\"why we stopped at this mcdonald's instead of driving to the mcdonald's on clark--which consistently provides amazing customer service that surely makes ray kroc smile in his grave--is beyond me. live and learn.\n",
